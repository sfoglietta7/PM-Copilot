## Install

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude plugin install .
```

Or install from a Git URL:

```bash
claude plugin install https://github.com/yourorg/pm-aios
```

### Claude Cowork (Desktop)

1. Open Claude Desktop and switch to the **Cowork** tab
2. Click **Customize** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Browse plugins** or upload the plugin folder directly
4. PM Copilot appears in your plugin list — click **Install**

### First Run

On first run, PM Copilot launches the onboarding wizard automatically. It asks 10 questions about your product, stack, stakeholders, and working style — then writes your persistent memory profile. Takes about 5 minutes, and you never have to re-brief Claude again.

You can also trigger it manually:

```
/onboarding
```

Or just say: *"I want to set up PM Copilot"*

---

## Quick Start

Once installed and onboarded:

| What you want to do | Command |
|---|---|
| Set up your PM profile (first time) | `/onboarding` |
| Start your day with a briefing | `/brief-me` |
| Write a PRD from a feature idea | `/write-prd smart notifications for enterprise users` |
| Review your roadmap | `/roadmap` |
| Send a stakeholder update | `/stakeholder-update` |
| Run a strategy review | `/strategy-review` |
| Triage user feedback | `/triage-feedback` |

Every command pulls your memory profile, loads relevant context files, and connects to your live tools (Linear, Jira, Slack, Notion) if configured. No re-briefing, no context-setting — just go.

---

## What's Inside

### 17 Slash Commands

Commands are chained workflows that wire multiple skills together into end-to-end operations.

### 65 PM Skills Across 12 Domains

Skills are the atomic units of PM knowledge. Each skill lives in `skills/[name]/SKILL.md`, fires automatically when relevant, and can also be invoked directly. Every skill loads your memory profile and offers to update it when done.

| Domain | Skills | Key Frameworks |
|---|---|---|
| **System** | Memory layer, Onboarding wizard, Gossip mode | Tal Raviv (onboarding pattern) |
| **Discovery** | Problem framing, Assumption mapping, JTBD analysis, OST, Continuous interview synthesis, Opportunity sizing, Switch interview | Teresa Torres (OST, CD), Bob Moesta (JTBD) |
| **Strategy** | Vision setting, North Star, OKR structuring, Competitive positioning, Beachhead mapping, Pre-mortem, Product work levels, 7 Powers, Strategy stack | Marty Cagan, Hamilton Helmer, Shreyas Doshi |
| **Execution** | PRD authoring, User story decomposition, Epic breakdown, Sprint prioritization, Prototype-ready spec | Pyramid Principle, Lenny's PRD guide |

| **Metrics & Data** | Cohort analysis, A/B test design, Funnel analysis, North Star selection, Dashboard structuring, SQL generation | North Star framework, AARRR, Lenny's guide |
| **AI Evals** | Error analysis, Eval suite design, LLM-as-judge, Human eval design, Regression testing, Improvement flywheel | Hamel Husain, Shreya Shankar |
| **Go-to-Market** | Launch planning, ICP definition, Messaging hierarchy, Growth loops, Pricing review, AI feature monetization, 5-component positioning | April Dunford (Obviously Awesome) |
| **Prototyping** | Vibe-coding from PRD, Prototype prompt, NLX design, Figma-to-prototype, Happy path scoping | Aparna Chennapragada (NLX), Colin Matthews |
| **Career Arc** | Solo PM to CPO, Altitude-horizon, Technical PM, Founding PM, Becoming Senior PM | Jackie Bavaro |

### 8 Specialized Sub-Agents

Sub-agents are isolated workers that handle complex, multi-step PM tasks. When a command or conversation requires deep work — discovery research, strategy analysis, document production — Claude automatically delegates to the right sub-agent. Each agent has relevant skills preloaded as domain knowledge and runs in focused isolation.

| Agent | What it handles | Preloaded Skills |
|---|---|---|
| **Discovery Researcher** | Problem framing, JTBD forces analysis, opportunity sizing, assumption mapping, interview synthesis | 7 discovery skills |
| **Strategy Analyst** | Vision setting, competitive positioning, 7 Powers analysis, OKR structuring, pre-mortems | 9 strategy skills |
| **Document Writer** | PRD authoring, user story decomposition, epic breakdown, prototype-ready specs | 5 execution skills |
| **Stakeholder Communicator** | Exec summaries, eng briefs, launch announcements, risk escalations, weekly digests | 6 stakeholder skills |
| **Market Researcher** | Persona development, journey mapping, TAM sizing, competitor battlecards, feedback triage | 6 market & users skills |
| **Metrics Analyst** | North Star selection, funnel analysis, A/B test design, cohort analysis, dashboard structuring | 6 metrics skills |
| **GTM Planner** | Launch planning, ICP definition, messaging hierarchy, positioning, pricing review | 7 GTM skills |
| **AI Evaluator** | Error analysis, eval suite design, LLM-as-judge pipelines, regression testing | 6 AI eval skills |

### Persistent User Memory

PM Copilot maintains a structured memory profile (`memory/user-profile.md`) that grows with every session. It stores:

- **Product context** — name, stage, core user problem, business model, current bets
- **Stack** — issue tracker, docs tool, comms tool, analytics tool, design tool
- **Working style** — PRD format preference, verbosity level, preferred frameworks, things to avoid
- **Stakeholders** — names, roles, communication styles, sensitivities, interaction history
- **Roadmap state** — Now / Next / Later items with dates, owners, and decisions
- **Open questions** — unresolved assumptions with dates (auto-surfaced when stale)
- **Tracked risks** — active risks with status (auto-prompted for review every 7 days)
- **Lessons learned** — insights from retros, tied to specific initiatives

**Session start protocol:** Every session, PM Copilot checks your memory for staleness (>7 days), aged open questions (>14 days), upcoming milestones (<7 days), and overdue roadmap items — then surfaces what needs attention before you even ask.

**Session end protocol:** After any meaningful session (PRD written, roadmap decision made, risk surfaced), PM Copilot offers to update your memory so the next session starts with full context.

### Live Tool Connectors (MCP)

Connect once, and every command pulls live data from your actual stack:

| Tool | What PM Copilot reads | What PM Copilot writes |
|---|---|---|
| **Linear** | Issues, roadmap state, sprint backlog, blockers | Tickets, status updates |
| **Jira** | Board, backlog, sprint state, blockers | Issues, status updates |
| **Notion** | Spec pages, knowledge base, meeting notes | Spec drafts, research docs |
| **Slack** | Channel context, thread sentiment, decisions, @mentions | Stakeholder updates |
| **GitHub** | Issue backlog, PR velocity, engineering output | — |

All connectors are optional. PM Copilot works fully without them — it just can't pull live data from your tools. Commands gracefully skip any connector that isn't configured.

### Gossip Mode

Speak informally — voice-to-text, stream-of-consciousness, "you won't believe what happened in standup" — and PM Copilot parses it into structured memory updates. It extracts stakeholder signals, roadmap changes, risks, decisions, and team dynamics, then offers to save them. Designed to complete in under 60 seconds.

## Platform Guide

PM Copilot runs on every Claude surface. Here's what to know for each.

### Claude Code (CLI)

This is the full-power experience. Everything works out of the box:

- All 17 slash commands via `/command-name`
- All 65 skills fire automatically based on context
- 8 specialized sub-agents for complex multi-step workflows
- MCP connectors via `.mcp.json` (Linear, Jira, Notion, Slack, GitHub)
- Sub-agent parallelism for commands like `/brief-me` and `/roadmap`
- File I/O for reading context, writing outputs, and updating memory
- `CLAUDE.md` loads automatically as global instructions

**Requirements:** Claude Code CLI installed, Node.js (for MCP servers via npx)

### Claude Cowork (Desktop)

Cowork provides the same skills and commands through a visual interface with autonomous task execution:

- All skills and slash commands work identically
- Connectors are set up through the **Customize > Connectors** UI (not `.mcp.json`)
- Sub-agents run in parallel with visual progress — often faster than Claude Code
- File-based memory works natively (Cowork reads/writes your local files)
- `CLAUDE.md` loads as project instructions

**Key differences from Claude Code:**
- Connector setup is via UI, not `.mcp.json` — see [Connector Setup](#connector-setup-claude-cowork)
- No terminal required — everything happens in the desktop app
- Tasks can be scheduled to run on a recurring basis

**Requirements:** Claude Desktop app with Cowork enabled (Pro or Max subscription, macOS)

---

## MCP Setup (Claude Code)

The `.mcp.json` file in the project root configures five MCP servers. Set environment variables for the connectors you use:

```bash
# Linear
export LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_...

# Jira
export JIRA_URL=https://yourorg.atlassian.net
export JIRA_EMAIL=you@company.com
export JIRA_API_TOKEN=...

# Notion
export NOTION_API_KEY=secret_...

# Slack
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
export SLACK_TEAM_ID=T...

# GitHub
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

Only configure the tools you use. Unconfigured connectors are silently skipped.

---

## Connector Setup (Claude Cowork)

In Cowork, connectors are managed through the UI instead of `.mcp.json`:

1. Open **Customize** in the Cowork sidebar
2. Go to **Connectors**
3. Search for and connect the tools you use: **Linear**, **Jira**, **Notion**, **Slack**, **GitHub**
4. Authenticate through each connector's OAuth flow

Once connected, PM Copilot commands automatically pull live data from your tools — no environment variables or config files needed.

## Customization

### Adding Your Context

The more context you provide, the better PM Copilot performs. Fill in the files under `context/`:

1. **`context/company/mission.md`** — Your company's mission, stage (pre-seed, seed, Series A, etc.), and core values. This calibrates all scoring and recommendations.
2. **`context/company/competitors.md`** — Key competitors and how you differentiate. Feeds battlecard generation and positioning skills.
3. **`context/company/customer-feedback.md`** — Recurring themes from support tickets, NPS, reviews. Grounds feedback triage in real signal.
4. **`context/product/personas.md`** — Your user personas. Use the template at `context/product/personas-template.md` to get started.
5. **`context/product/roadmap.md`** — Your current roadmap. Use the template at `context/product/roadmap-template.md`.

### Adjusting the Quality Bar

Edit `CLAUDE.md` to change global behavior:
- Modify the **Session Start Protocol** to change what gets surfaced on each session
- Adjust **Framework Defaults** to swap in your preferred frameworks
- Change **Output Conventions** for different scoring scales, output formats, or save paths

### Adding Your Own Skills

Create a new folder under `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file. Claude Code auto-discovers all skills at `skills/[name]/SKILL.md` — no registration needed.

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: When to trigger this skill and when not to
version: 2.0.0
---

Your skill instructions here. Follow the pattern:
1. Load context (memory + relevant files)
2. Do the work
3. Produce output
4. Offer to save and update memory
```

---

## FAQ

**Does PM Copilot work without any MCP connectors?**
Yes. Every command has a no-connector fallback. You lose live data pulls, but all frameworks, memory, and skill logic work fully.

**Does it work without filling in the memory profile?**
Yes, but it will prompt you to onboard. Commands without memory context ask 3 targeted questions, proceed with the answers, and offer to save to memory afterward.

**Can I use it with both Linear and Jira?**
Yes. Configure both and commands will pull from whichever is connected. If both are active, both are queried.

**How is memory different from chat history?**
Chat history resets each session. Memory persists across sessions in `memory/user-profile.md` — it's a structured file you can read, edit, or delete at any time.

**Can I use this on Claude.ai web?**
Skills and CLAUDE.md work on Claude.ai web through Projects. Slash commands and MCP connectors require Claude Code or Cowork.

**Is my data sent anywhere?**
No. Everything runs locally. Memory, context files, and outputs stay on your machine. MCP connectors connect directly to your tools' APIs — nothing routes through a third party.
