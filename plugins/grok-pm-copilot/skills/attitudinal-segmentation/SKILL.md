# Attitudinal Segmentation

You are helping the user move beyond demographic segmentation (role, company size, industry) to attitudinal segmentation â€” grouping users by how they think and behave, which predicts product adoption and communication effectiveness far better than demographics.

Framework: Hilary Gridley (AI embracer vs. skeptic segmentation), Lenny Rachitsky (counterintuitive advice for AI products).

Key principle: "The most meaningful segmentation for AI products is attitudinal: AI embracers vs. AI skeptics. Skeptics can become superusers â€” but they require a completely different journey." â€” Hilary Gridley, Lenny's Newsletter (2024)

## Step 1 â€” Load Context

Read `memory/user-profile.md` and `context/product/personas.md`. Understand the existing segments and whether they're demographically or attitudinally defined.

## Step 2 â€” The Core Attitudinal Dimensions

For any product, but especially AI-powered products, segment users on these dimensions:

**Adoption attitude:** How quickly and enthusiastically does the user adopt new tools?
- **Pioneer:** Seeks out new tools actively; has a high tolerance for rough edges
- **Early adopter:** Picks up tools when there's a clear value proposition; needs a bit less friction
- **Pragmatist:** Adopts only when peers adopt; needs social proof and clear ROI
- **Conservative:** Adopts last; needs extensive proof and low switching cost
- **Skeptic:** Actively resists; may become a user only under external pressure

**AI-specific attitude (especially relevant for PM Copilot):**
- **AI Embracer:** Excited; self-directed; builds habits quickly; tolerates setup friction
  - Onboarding: jump to advanced features; show full capability surface
  - Messaging: potential, speed, customization
- **AI Neutral:** Pragmatic; will use AI if it saves time; skeptical of hype
  - Onboarding: show concrete time saved before/after; quick wins first
  - Messaging: efficiency, reliability
- **AI Skeptic:** Trusts proven frameworks; fears losing craft or voice; needs to see before committing
  - Onboarding: lead with framework credibility; show sample outputs first; emphasize control
  - Messaging: augmentation not replacement; familiar frameworks; quality over speed

**Craft orientation (relevant for knowledge work tools):**
- **Craft-protective:** Sees the product as a tool they control; quality of output matters as much as speed
- **Output-focused:** Wants to move fast; good enough is fine; speed over polish
- **Collaborative:** Uses the tool to think alongside; wants an interlocutor, not a generator

## Step 3 â€” Apply to Your User Base

Based on research, analytics, or intuition, estimate the distribution of each segment in the user base:

**For AI-attitude segmentation:**
- What % of your users are AI Embracers? (Signs: high feature adoption, exploring advanced commands, light touch on instructions)
- What % are AI Skeptics? (Signs: low feature adoption, high support contact about AI outputs, explicit feedback about feeling like AI is "taking over")
- What % are Neutral? (Signs: transactional use, specific task-oriented, don't explore)

If no data exists, structure a 3â€“5 question survey to measure attitudinal segments.

## Step 4 â€” Implications by Segment

For each identified segment:

**Product implications:**
- What features matter most to them?
- What features would alienate them?
- What onboarding experience do they need?

**Retention implications:**
- What causes them to stay (or leave)?
- What habit formation mechanism works for them?
- What proactive check-in approach resonates?

**Messaging implications:**
- What headline resonates?
- What evidence format is most persuasive (testimonials, data, framework credibility)?
- What words or phrases to avoid?

## Step 5 â€” Conversion Paths

Identify the conversion path from Skeptic â†’ Neutral â†’ Embracer:

What specific experience or moment converts a Skeptic to a Neutral user? (Usually: a single output that impresses them and matches their quality bar)

What converts a Neutral to an Embracer? (Usually: discovering a second or third use case that makes the tool feel indispensable)

Design the product experience to facilitate these conversions deliberately.

## Step 6 â€” Output

Produce:
- Attitudinal segment definitions and estimated distribution for your product
- Implications matrix (segment Ã— product / retention / messaging)
- Conversion path design
- Top 3 actions to improve experience for the segment most at risk of churn

Offer to update `context/product/personas.md` with attitudinal layer and save insights to `memory/user-profile.md`.
