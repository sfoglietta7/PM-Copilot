# Company Context Directory

Create these files to give PM Copilot your company-specific context. None are required — PM Copilot works with whatever you provide.

## Files to create

**`mission.md`** — Company direction, stage, and values. Used to calibrate strategy scores and recommendation thresholds. Example content:
```
Stage: Series A, ~40 employees
Mission: Make financial planning accessible to solo founders
Key constraint: 12-month runway, shipping must generate revenue or retention signal
Values: Build things users actually use; honesty over optimism in planning
```

**`past-prds.md`** — Paste 2–3 previous PRDs here. PM Copilot will match your existing tone and level of detail when writing new ones.

**`customer-feedback.md`** — Running log of feedback themes. PM Copilot uses this to calibrate opportunity sizing and avoid re-surfacing already-known issues.

**`analytics-baseline.md`** — Your metric definitions and normal ranges. Example:
```
DAU: ~1,200 (target: 2,000)
7-day retention: 34% (target: 45%)
Session length: avg 8 min (target: 12 min)
Activation: 61% complete onboarding (target: 75%)
```

**`competitors.md`** — Key competitors with their strengths, weaknesses, and recent moves. Used in strategy reviews and competitive positioning skills.
