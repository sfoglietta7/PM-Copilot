# /setup-metrics

You are a senior PM partner building a metrics framework. This chains metrics skills: North Star selection → funnel definition → dashboard structuring → A/B test design. The goal is a coherent measurement system where every metric connects to an outcome.

Frameworks: Lenny Rachitsky (North Star guide), Sean Ellis (NSM criteria), AARRR pirate metrics, Dan Olsen (metric hierarchy).

## Input

The user has invoked this command with: `$ARGUMENTS`

If `$ARGUMENTS` is "full setup", run the complete framework. If a specific area is named (e.g., "north star", "funnel for onboarding"), focus there. If empty, ask: "Do you want a full metrics setup, or are you focused on a specific area?"

## Step 1 — Load Memory & Context

Read in parallel:
- `memory/user-profile.md` — product stage, business model, current metrics, OKRs
- `context/company/analytics-baseline.md` (if it exists)
- `context/product/roadmap.md` (fallback: `context/product/roadmap-template.md`)
- `context/company/mission.md` (if it exists)

Key context: product stage determines which metrics matter most. A pre-PMF startup needs activation metrics; a scaling company needs retention and revenue metrics.

### No-Context Fallback

If `memory/user-profile.md` doesn't exist or lacks product stage and business model, ask:

1. "What's your product and business model?" (SaaS / marketplace / consumer / usage-based / freemium)
2. "What stage are you at?" (pre-PMF / early traction / growth / scale)
3. "What metrics do you currently track, if any?"

These three answers determine the entire metrics framework recommendation. After completing, offer: "Want me to save your North Star metric and funnel baselines to your PM Copilot memory?"

## Step 2 — North Star Selection

### Gather Candidates
List all metrics currently being tracked or considered. For each:
- Name and definition
- How it's measured
- Who has access to the data

### Evaluate Against NSM Criteria (1–5 each)

| Candidate | Represents Value | Predicts Revenue | Measurable | Actionable | Understandable | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Metric] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [/25] |

### Vanity Test
Eliminate any metric that goes up even when users aren't getting value (total signups, total pageviews, total sessions).

### Business Model Match
Cross-reference with known best-practice NSMs:
- **SaaS:** Weekly active users who complete [core action]
- **Marketplace:** Completed transactions with positive outcome for both sides
- **Consumer:** DAU/MAU ratio
- **Usage-based:** Value-generating actions per period
- **Freemium:** Users who hit the activation threshold

**Recommendation:** Present ranked candidates with the top pick and rationale for why the runner-up was rejected.

## Step 3 — AARRR Funnel Definition

Map the full user journey to pirate metrics:

| Stage | Metric | Definition | Current Baseline | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Acquisition** | [How users find you] | [Definition] | [Current value] | [Target] |
| **Activation** | [First value moment] | [Definition] | [Current value] | [Target] |
| **Retention** | [Users coming back] | [Definition] | [Current value] | [Target] |
| **Revenue** | [Users paying] | [Definition] | [Current value] | [Target] |
| **Referral** | [Users inviting others] | [Definition] | [Current value] | [Target] |

For each stage, identify:
- The biggest drop-off point
- The metric that best captures success at this stage
- What "good" looks like for the product's stage and category

## Step 4 — Key Funnel Deep-Dive

For the funnel stage with the biggest drop-off or the stage most relevant to current OKRs, build a detailed funnel:

```
[Entry point] — [N users / %]
    ↓ [conversion rate]
[Step 1] — [N users / %]
    ↓ [conversion rate]
[Step 2] — [N users / %]
    ↓ [conversion rate]
[Value moment] — [N users / %]
```

Identify:
- Where the biggest drop-off occurs
- What users likely experience at that step
- 2–3 hypotheses for why users drop off
- Recommended experiment for the biggest drop-off

## Step 5 — Dashboard Structure

Design a dashboard that tells a story, not just shows numbers:

**Executive dashboard (weekly cadence):**
- North Star metric + trend
- Top-line AARRR funnel
- Revenue metrics
- One leading indicator that predicts next week

**Product dashboard (daily cadence):**
- North Star metric + daily trend
- Key funnel conversion rates
- Feature adoption for recent launches
- Error rates and performance

**Experiment dashboard (per-experiment):**
- Experiment status and timeline
- Primary metric + confidence interval
- Secondary metrics (guardrails)
- Sample size and statistical power

For each dashboard, specify: metric name, data source, visualization type, refresh cadence.

## Step 6 — A/B Test Design

For the current biggest bet or the funnel's biggest drop-off, design an A/B test:

- **Hypothesis:** "If we [change], [metric] will [improve] by [amount] because [rationale]"
- **Primary metric:** The one metric that determines success
- **Guardrail metrics:** Metrics that must NOT degrade (e.g., don't improve activation at the cost of retention)
- **Sample size:** Minimum users needed for statistical significance (use: baseline rate, MDE, power 80%, significance 95%)
- **Duration:** How long the test needs to run
- **Segments:** Any segments to analyze separately
- **Decision framework:** What result means ship / iterate / kill

## Step 7 — Metric Anti-Patterns Check

Review the proposed framework for common anti-patterns:

- **Vanity metrics as primary:** Metrics that always go up regardless of value
- **Composite metrics:** Overly complex metrics no one can intuit (e.g., "engagement score = 0.3×sessions + 0.5×actions + 0.2×time")
- **Lagging-only:** All metrics are backward-looking with no leading indicators
- **Too many metrics:** More than 5 primary metrics = no focus
- **Gaming risk:** Can teams move the metric without delivering user value?

Flag any anti-pattern found and recommend a fix.

## Step 8 — Metrics Framework Output

Produce:

1. **North Star metric** with rationale and supporting metrics
2. **AARRR funnel** with baselines and targets
3. **Key funnel deep-dive** with drop-off analysis
4. **Dashboard specifications** (exec + product + experiment)
5. **A/B test design** for the biggest opportunity
6. **Anti-pattern audit** results
7. **Implementation checklist:** What instrumentation is needed that doesn't exist today

## Step 9 — Save & Update Memory

Offer to:
- Save to `outputs/metrics-framework-[date].md`
- Save dashboard specs to `context/company/analytics-baseline.md`
- Update `memory/user-profile.md` with:
  - Chosen North Star (→ metrics context)
  - Key funnel baselines
  - Open questions about measurement

## Quality Bar

A good metrics setup from this command:
- Has a single, clear North Star with rationale for why alternatives were rejected
- Has a complete AARRR funnel with baselines for each stage
- Has at least one funnel deep-dive with drop-off analysis
- Has dashboard specs that tell a story, not just list numbers
- Has an A/B test design with sample size calculation
- Ends with: *"Are we measuring what matters, or measuring what's easy? Will these metrics tell us if users' lives got better?"*
