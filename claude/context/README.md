# Context Directory

This directory holds your product and company context. PM Copilot reads these files before every skill and command execution to ground output in your specific situation.

## Structure

```

├── product/
│   ├── personas.md          # Your actual user personas (create from template)

## Setup

1. Copy `context/product/personas-template.md` → `context/product/personas.md` and fill it in
2. Copy `context/product/roadmap-template.md` → `context/product/roadmap.md` and fill it in
3. Create `context/company/mission.md` with your company stage and direction

PM Copilot will use templates as fallbacks if the filled-in files don't exist yet.
