# Sprint Prioritization

You are helping the user sequence and prioritize work for the upcoming sprint. Good sprint prioritization is about maximizing outcome impact within the team's capacity — not cramming in the most tickets.

Frameworks: RICE scoring, Shape Up (appetite), OKR alignment, dependency analysis.

## Step 1 — Load Context

Read `memory/user-profile.md` for roadmap state, current OKRs, and team context. Read `context/product/roadmap.md` for Now/Next lists. Pull Linear/Jira state if MCP is connected.

## Step 2 — Establish Sprint Constraints

Clarify:
- Sprint duration (1 week / 2 weeks / other)
- Team capacity (number of engineers, any vacations or context-switching)
- Committed work (anything already promised to stakeholders or dependent teams)
- North Star context: which metric are we trying to move this sprint?

## Step 3 — Capture the Candidate Items

List all items under consideration for the sprint. For each, capture (or estimate):
- Item name and brief description
- Which OKR it serves (or doesn't)
- RICE score components: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort
- Dependencies: does it require something to be done first?
- Type: feature / bug / tech debt / experiment / maintenance

## Step 4 — RICE Scoring

Calculate RICE for each item:

**Reach:** How many users affected per sprint? (Use actual numbers or % of user base)
**Impact:** 0.25 = minimal / 0.5 = low / 1 = medium / 2 = high / 3 = massive
**Confidence:** 20% = guess / 50% = some data / 80% = strong data / 100% = proven
**Effort:** Person-weeks to complete

**RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

Sort by RICE score descending.

## Step 5 — OKR Alignment Filter

After RICE scoring, apply an OKR filter:
- Items that serve a current OKR get a priority boost
- Items that don't serve any OKR are categorized as: maintenance (justified), tech debt (track separately), or misaligned (discuss)

Final priority = RICE × OKR alignment weight (1.0 if serves OKR, 0.7 if maintenance, 0.5 if misaligned)

## Step 6 — Dependency Check

For each candidate item, check:
- Does it depend on something not yet done?
- Does something else depend on it (would delaying it cascade)?
- Is there a critical path item that should jump the queue?

Flag dependency issues and adjust sequencing.

## Step 7 — Sprint Recommendation

Based on scoring and capacity:
1. **Must do this sprint:** High RICE + serves OKR + within capacity
2. **Should do if capacity allows:** Medium RICE + serves OKR
3. **Defer:** Low RICE or no OKR link or dependent items not ready
4. **Never:** Items that consistently appear in Defer — escalate for backlog grooming or deletion

Output a sprint plan with estimated capacity usage per item.

## Step 8 — Tradeoff Discussion

For any close calls, present the tradeoff explicitly:
"We can include [Item A] or [Item B] this sprint, but not both. [Item A] has higher RICE but [Item B] is needed before [upstream dependency]. Recommendation: [which to choose and why]."

Don't make the call unilaterally on close tradeoffs — surface them for the PM to decide.
